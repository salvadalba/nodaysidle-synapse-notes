# 🧠 Synapse Notes: Your Second Brain, Powered by Your Voice

Synapse Notes is an **audio-first knowledge base** designed to capture your thoughts at the speed of speech and automatically organize them into a meaningful network of ideas.

## 🚀 The Core Idea

Most note-taking apps require you to type, categorize, and tag everything manually. This creates "friction" that often stops you from capturing great ideas when they happen.

**Synapse Notes flips the script.**

You talk, and the AI does the heavy lifting:

1. **Listen**: Captures your raw audio.
2. **Understand**: Transcribes and summarizes your thoughts.
3. **Connect**: Links new notes to previous ones based on what they *mean*, not just common keywords.
4. **Visualize**: Shows you a "Knowledge Graph" of your mind.
